/**
 * The mods that are known to fight the region model, and the fail-closed action of each kind of conflict.
 * <p>
 * The table is a static list, not a detection result: it names a mod id, the kind of hazard the mod is known
 * to introduce and why. At server start {@link #plan(boolean, boolean, boolean)} turns the loaded mods into
 * a {@link Plan}, and the plan is what {@code ServerLifecycleHooks} installs - an affected slice stays off, or
 * the engine is not installed at all, and the plan's lines are logged once at that severity. Nothing in the
 * table can widen what the engine does; every action is fail-closed.
 * <p>
 * The ids are the pack inventory's mod ids (the leading token of the mod jar names of the 170-mod
 * compatibility pack recorded in {@code .pi/tasks/modpack-compat-notes.md}); the hazards are the ones that
 * document records. An entry whose id does not match a loaded mod never fires, so a wrong id costs the
 * protection of that one row and never a wrong decision for another mod.
 * <p>
 * What is <em>not</em> detectable and therefore not in the table: whether a mod's mixin actually targets one
 * of the classes whose semantics the engine changes ({@code EntityTickList},
 * {@code PersistentEntitySectionManager}, {@code ChunkMap}, {@code ServerChunkCache}, {@code LevelChunk},
 * {@code ServerLevel}). A mixin configuration names only the mixin classes; the target of each of them lives
 * in the mixin class's own bytecode, so answering the question at runtime means opening every mod jar,
 * recursing into jar-in-jar bundles and parsing class files (that offline scan is what produced the 63/4/3
 * mixin counts of the compatibility note). Mixin exposes no transformer-to-target query either, and this
 * tree has no transformation audit trail to read the answer from. Forgia therefore reports only the known
 * table and says so in {@link #DETECTION_LIMITS}, instead of claiming an unknown-risk detection it does not
 * have.
