/**
 * Shared lifecycle of one level tick that is executed on region workers.
 * <p>
 * The batch is published on the engine <em>before</em> any region lease is acquired, and it owns the
 * completion latch of the whole lifecycle: setup (lease acquisition and group submission), every worker
 * group, and the server-thread post-processing. A concurrent shutdown or level unload that observes the
 * batch therefore cannot retire a region that the batch still holds or is about to lease.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses add their region groups through {@link #addTask(String, Runnable)}; the work is wrapped by
 * {@link #groupWork(Runnable)} so a group the executor rejected and that therefore runs inline on the
 * publishing thread still marks that thread as executing this batch.
 * <p>
 * The batch also owns the deferred block-write effects of its groups ({@link RegionDeferredBlockUpdates}).
 * {@link #groupWork(Runnable)} installs the queue of the batch for the duration of every group, so a worker of
 * any slice - block entity, entity, chunk or scheduled tick - records the light rechecks and the block update
 * publications of the blocks it writes instead of driving the level-wide light engine and the level-wide block
 * update publication itself, and the completion chain of the batch applies them on the server thread.
 * <p>
 * A worker group that catches a failing tick records it through {@link #recordTickFailure(RegionCoordinate,
 * Entity, Throwable)} and stops; the batch keeps that record bounded and {@link #throwIfFailed()} reports it on
 * the server thread, so the crash report of a failing tick is never built by a worker the server thread is
 * waiting for. See {@link RegionTickFailure}.
