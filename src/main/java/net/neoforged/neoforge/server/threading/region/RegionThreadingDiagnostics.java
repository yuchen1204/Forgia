/**
 * Snapshot of the internal region threading runtime state.
 * <p>
 * The transfer counters report the recorded cross-region entity transfer transaction: the decisions that
 * still wait for a commit, the terminal results kept for idempotent replays, and the recordings the journal
 * bound refused. A refused recording leaves the caller on the vanilla path, so a growing rejection count is
 * the only observable sign that the pending bound of the journal is exhausted.
 * <p>
 * The deferred counters report the ownership handoffs of a finished entity batch. A deferred move whose
 * destination was captured at defer time is committed through the recorded transaction; the legacy count
 * reports the handoffs the transaction refused and that were therefore published from the live position
 * like before, and the retried count reports the handoffs a busy region delayed to a later barrier.
 * <p>
 * The two section counters report the level effects of a worker entity move that the batch barrier applied
 * or dropped. An applied count is one entity section publication plus its target chunk acquisition, both
 * run on the server thread. A dropped count is one update that did not complete: the engine shut down
 * (including the updates a shut-down batch releases without applying), the level identity closed, the
 * entity was removed or left the level, or the publication or the chunk acquisition threw. A dropped
 * update never leaves a section publication behind, and a failing update never costs the updates queued
 * behind it. {@link #droppedDeferredEntitySectionUpdatesForRemovedEntity()} is the subset of the dropped
 * updates whose entity was removed, left the level or was never added to it between the move and the
 * barrier: the removal already retired the section membership, so dropping the publication loses nothing.
 * The rest of the dropped count is the update that really lost a move.
 * <p>
 * The three removal counters report the level callback of a worker entity removal that the batch barrier
 * applied, dropped or turned into a no-op. An applied count is one normal removal path on the server thread:
 * the identity departure, the section removal, the tracking and ticking stop, the destruction callback and
 * the region retirement. A dropped count is one removal that did not complete (the engine shut down, the
 * level identity closed, the entity left the level, it was revived, or its callback threw). A repeated count
 * is one removal request that was a no-op because the entity was already recorded or its removal had already
 * been applied; a repeat is never a second removal.
 * <p>
 * {@link #entityAddRejectedOnWorker()} counts the entity spawns a native region worker attempted and the
 * storage guard refused: death loot, experience orbs, projectiles and every other entity a worker-side tick
 * tries to create. It counts both the position write of the new entity outside the leased region and the
 * admission into the level that could not be deferred, so one refused spawn attempt is counted once. A spawn
 * the lease records is not counted here: it is deferred and shows up in the admission counters instead.
 * <p>
 * The three admission counters report the entity additions a worker recorded and the batch barrier applied
 * or dropped. A recorded admission is one riding graph the worker constructed and configured inside its
 * leased region; an applied admission is that graph admitted into the level by the unmodified vanilla path
 * on the server thread. A dropped admission is one that never reached the level - the engine shut down, the
 * level identity closed, the entity was removed before the barrier, a member of the graph was already in the
 * level, or the vanilla path refused a member - and it <b>loses the entity</b>, because the entity was never
 * in the level and nothing retries it. That is why a dropped admission is always counted and never silently
 * skipped.
 * <p>
 * The two ownership counters report the entity tick lease of a region worker group. An allowance counts
 * one grant of a vanilla entity mutation the lease may own: it is the lease decision, not a completed
 * mutation, so one vanilla call can record several allowances when it enters several granted guard sites.
 * An ownership rejection counts one worker entity mutation the active lease refused, including the removal
 * operations and the position changes of an entity that is already added to a level. Every such refusal
 * also increments {@link #ownershipViolationCount()}, because the guard still reports the operation and
 * throws before it mutates anything. A worker entity mutation without an active lease is not an ownership
 * decision: it only increments {@link #ownershipViolationCount()}.
 * <p>
 * The three query counters report the region-scoped entity query of a leased native worker. An allowed
 * query is one entity query that ran against the lease instead of the legacy guard - a box query, a
 * {@code getAll()}, a type-filtered lookup or a by-id/by-uuid lookup the region's index answered - a
 * truncated query is one allowed query whose box extended past the leased region and was clamped to it, and
 * a rejected query is one legacy query the storage guard refused on a native worker, including a player
 * lookup of a level whose player snapshot is not published. A rejected query is
 * always counted with {@link #ownershipViolationCount()} as well, because the guard reports the operation and
 * throws. The counters make the clamp-and-count contract observable: a truncated query never silently loses
 * the entities outside the lease.
 * <p>
 * {@link #entityQueryPaths()} splits the same answers per entry point - {@code get(int)}, {@code get(UUID)},
 * {@code getAll()}, the type-filtered lookup, the two box queries and the player lookups - into the four
 * answers a worker can receive: local (the region's index or its section bucket), published (the per-tick
 * player snapshot), truncated (a local answer that is not the whole level answer) and refused (no local or
 * published answer was available, so the legacy guard refused the operation and threw). One call can
 * count in two columns, e.g. a player-typed box query counts local for its region bucket and published for
 * the players the snapshot adds. {@link #playerSnapshotsPublished()} counts the per-tick publications
 * themselves, so a worker's one-tick-stale player view is observable next to the answers it produced.
 * <p>
 * {@link #regionChunkSize()} is the edge length in chunks of one region coordinate of the installed
 * layout. For a fixed policy it is the configured fixed region size, so the status output and every
 * diagnostic consumer read the same value the engine and the physical section partitions use.
 * <p>
 * The four phase counters report the explicit global/region phase of the level tick ({@link LevelTickPhase}).
 * {@link #globalPhases()} counts the global segments the engine bridge opened, {@link #regionPhases()} the
 * region batches it entered, {@link #regionPhasesWithoutGlobalPhase()} the region batches that ran outside a
 * level tick (direct engine use from a mechanics test or a benchmark, never production) and
 * {@link #abandonedGlobalSegments()} the global segments a level tick left open because it threw. A phase
 * violation - a global segment opened while a batch was in flight, or two batches of one level at once - is
 * counted with {@link #ownershipViolationCount()}.
 * <p>
 * The seven mailbox counters report the cross-region mailbox of every level that has one
 * ({@link RegionMailbox}). {@link #mailboxAcceptedMessages()} counts the posts that were queued,
 * {@link #mailboxDeliveredMessages()} the messages a delivery actually ran, and the remaining counters the
 * messages that never ran: {@link #mailboxRefusedFullMessages()} the posts refused by a full queue,
 * {@link #mailboxRefusedClosedMessages()} the posts refused by a closed mailbox,
 * {@link #mailboxDroppedRetiredMessages()} the messages whose target region did not exist or retired before the
 * delivery, {@link #mailboxDroppedOnCloseMessages()} the messages dropped by a close or by a post that raced it,
 * and {@link #mailboxDeliveryFailures()} the delivered messages whose body threw. Every message reaches exactly
 * one of accepted, refused or dropped, so no message is ever lost silently.
 * <p>
 * The per-slice block-update counters report the light rechecks and block update publications every region batch
 * defers: one batch of the block-entity, entity, chunk or scheduled tick slice records the writes of its workers
 * and the server thread applies them at its barrier, because the light engine and the block update publication
 * of a level are level-wide. {@link BlockUpdateCounters} reports the records each slice applied, the records it
 * dropped because its level closed and the units it refused before their body because the batch could not
 * reserve them.
 * <p>
 * {@link TickFailureCounters} reports the tick failures the worker groups of each slice recorded, counted per
 * slice. A worker that catches a failing tick records the throwable and the context and stops its group; the
 * server thread reports it after the barrier and after the handoff of the batch, so the crash report of a
 * failing tick is never built on a worker that the server thread is waiting for. A counted failure is one
 * failure, counted on the worker and reported once by the server thread.
 * <p>
 * The four block-entity chunk counters report the chunks the chunk-indexed plan did not hand to a worker, by
 * reason. A non-ticking chunk is out of block ticking range or the tick rate is frozen, a chunk whose entities
 * are still loading keeps the vanilla skip, and a chunk that is no longer loaded has no snapshot at all; none
 * of them ticks this tick, exactly like the vanilla ticker loop skips them. A stale snapshot counts a chunk
 * whose ticker set or chunk instance changed between the plan and the worker tick, so its tickers were
 * revalidated and ticked on the server thread instead of from the stale snapshot. The first three counters
 * therefore measure work the plan avoided, and the last one measures the safety net.
 * <p>
 * Chunk guard refusals count requests which cannot be served immediately to a native worker. A pre-load
 * refusal counts an entity kept off a worker before its tick because its chunk neighborhood is not loaded.
 * The legacy {@code chunkFallbackEntityTicks} accessor remains for diagnostics compatibility and now stays
 * zero: an already-started tick is never restarted after a chunk refusal. Such failures use the normal
 * worker tick failure counters and server-thread report. A refused request is not a completed continuation.
 * <p>
 * {@link #regionizerWriteLockAcquisitions()} counts the write-lock acquisitions of the regionizer, so the
 * publication scope of one entity batch barrier is observable: a barrier that publishes its deferred
 * ownership updates in one batch takes one write lock for all of them, and a barrier that publishes them one
 * by one takes one per update. {@link #batchedDeferredEntityMoves()} counts the deferred updates a barrier
 * resolved through that batch, either by publishing an untracked entity or by reporting a cross-region move
 * to the recorded transfer transaction; {@link #unchangedDeferredEntityMoves()} counts the updates that named
 * the region their entity was already mapped to and therefore published nothing;
 * {@link #refusedDeferredEntityMoveBatches()} counts the batches the regionizer refused as a whole, whose
 * updates the barrier then published per entity. {@link #scheduledTaskMigrations()} counts the scheduled
 * entity tasks a move notification had to migrate to the region that now contains the task's entity.
 * <p>
 * The spawn counters report the natural spawning slice. A spawn chunk on a worker is one chunk whose spawn body
 * ran on the worker of its region, against that region's own spawn state. Every other chunk is counted by the
 * reason it stayed on the server thread: the vanilla spawn gate refused it (no body runs, exactly like vanilla),
 * a neighboring chunk is not loaded, the batch had no room for the block writes of its body, it was collected
 * after its batch already ran, its region could not be leased or the engine had already shut down. None of them
 * is dropped: every chunk that keeps the server thread spawns there, from the vanilla level-wide state.
 * {@link #truncatedSpawnChunks()} counts chunks whose worker body a chunk source refusal truncated after it had
 * already spawned: the spawns it recorded are admitted, the rest of the attempt is lost. {@link #capRefusedSpawns()}
 * counts the mob categories a region's spawn state refused because the level-wide cap was reached, and
 * {@link #refusedSpawnAdditions()} counts spawn attempts that could not be recorded for the barrier at all, so no
 * entity was created.
 * <p>
 * {@link #regionTicks()} holds the per-region tick metrics of every live region and {@link #regionMetrics()}
 * their aggregate; both are immutable snapshots taken at the same moment as this record.
 * {@link RegionTickSnapshot} documents what region MSPT and region TPS mean, the window they are measured
 * over and how a tick is classified as keeping up or behind. A diagnostics call without any live region -
 * including a call on a server that never installed the engine - reports an empty region list and a summary
 * of zero regions, and such a server records no per-region metric at all.
 * <p>
 * {@link #serverThreadOnlyEntityTicks()} counts the ticks a region handed to the server thread because the
 * entity is always-ticking (a player).
 * {@link #serverThreadOnlyEntityTicksByReason()} counts the ticks a region handed to the server thread because
 * of a per-type declaration ({@link RegionThreadingEngine#serverThreadOnlyEntity(Class, String)}), one entry
 * per reason token, ordered by token. It answers why an entity tick stayed on the server thread and not only
 * how many did; a type without a declaration keeps the worker and never appears here.
 * <p>
 * {@link #deferredPortalTransitions()}, {@link #appliedPortalTransitions()} and
 * {@link #refusedPortalTransitions()} report the portal transitions of worker-ticked entities. The
 * destination search of a transition reads the {@code PoiManager} of the destination level, which is one
 * storage per level, and every entity type reaches it from its own tick, so a worker records the transition
 * instead of resolving it. A deferred transition is one record a batch barrier drained; applied is one the
 * server thread resolved and applied in that same tick; refused is one it could not apply (the engine shut
 * down, the level identity closed, the entity was removed or left the level). A refused transition is never
 * lost: the entity keeps its portal state, so a later tick records it again.
 * <p>
 * {@link GameEventCounters} reports the cross-region game event capture. The unit of its counters is one chunk
 * column of one dispatch, because the vanilla dispatch iterates the chunks of an event's notification radius and
 * the sections of each chunk, and a listener writes its own block entity: with a 3-chunk region a worker's
 * dispatch crosses a region border in the common case. A posted event is counted while a region batch of the
 * level is in flight, a local column is one the posting worker visited itself, a deferred column one it recorded
 * for the owning region, a delivered column one that region replayed on its own worker, a refused column one the
 * capture bound refused at the call site, and a dropped column one that was never replayed. Every column reaches
 * exactly one of visited, replayed or dropped.
 * <p>
 * {@link PlayerRegionCounters} reports the region transitions of players, which are published at the start of the
 * entity slice of the level they are in ({@link PlayerRegionTransitions}). A transition is one departure plus one
 * entry and is counted by its cause; a publication that the defined point refused because a batch of the level
 * was in flight, the engine had shut down or the level identity had closed is counted as refused, and an
 * attempt of that kind is counted as a transition during a batch. A deferred arrival is a tick list membership
 * of a player whose region mapping is published at the next defined point, which is what a login and the arrival
 * half of a dimension change are. The invariant counters report the audits of "a player is in exactly one region
 * of each level it is in": {@link #playerRegionInvariantFailures()} must stay zero.
