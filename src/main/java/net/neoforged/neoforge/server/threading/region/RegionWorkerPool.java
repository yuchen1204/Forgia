/**
 * Worker pool reserved for native region execution.
 * <p>
 * The pool has two dispatch paths. The default path hands a task to a fixed thread pool; the persistent path
 * gives every worker its own deque instead: the submitting thread pushes a task onto the deque of an idle worker,
 * or of the worker with the least work pending when none is idle, that worker pops its own tasks from the back of
 * its deque, and a worker that runs out of its own work steals from the front of another worker's deque. The
 * owner end and the thief end are opposite, so an idle worker takes the task that has waited longest while the
 * owner keeps the task it pushed last, and a worker with nothing to do never waits for the worker that happens to
 * be busy with the slowest region of the batch. The persistent path removes the shared queue lock, the executor's
 * worker publication and most of the wake-up latency of a per-tick batch, which is what a light workload pays for
 * in full. The executor path is kept and is used whenever the persistent path is not installed, so a shutdown or
 * a configuration that cannot use it falls back to the unchanged behaviour. Larger persistent batches also
 * use {@link RegionWorkStealingDispatcher}: one runner per worker drains and steals ranges of unstarted
 * tasks, avoiding a queue node and worker-selection scan for every independent region task.
 * <p>
 * The dispatch handshake is spin-then-park. A worker spins on the sequence number of its own deque, then scans
 * the deques of the other workers once per spin period, and only then parks with a bounded park. A submission
 * advances a pool-wide work epoch and unparks one parked worker (the worker it pushed to, or another one that
 * then steals the task), and a worker reads that epoch after it published its parked flag, so an offer that
 * races the park decision is either seen by the worker that decided to park or by the scan of the submitter.
 * No wake-up is lost and an idle worker is never woken without work to take.
 * <p>
 * {@link #close()} only returns after every worker thread terminated. Work that was accepted before the close
 * is always executed (it holds region leases and batch barriers that other threads wait for), and an interrupt
 * of the closing thread only escalates to interrupting the workers without abandoning the wait. A task that
 * neither returns nor reacts to interrupts therefore blocks shutdown instead of letting the server continue
 * while a worker can still mutate level state. A submission that arrives after the close is refused and runs on
 * the submitting thread instead.
