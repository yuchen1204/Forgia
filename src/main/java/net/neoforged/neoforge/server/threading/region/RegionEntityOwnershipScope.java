/**
 * Entity ownership lease of exactly one region worker group.
 * <p>
 * The scope carries the leased level and region as one {@link RegionCoordinate}, the
 * {@link RegionOwnershipLeaseGroup} that answers {@link RegionOwnershipLeaseGroup#owns(Entity)} and defers the
 * storage effects of a granted mutation, and a monotonically increasing lease id. It is installed around the
 * worker tick loop of that group only and removed in a {@code finally}, so a worker task outside the tick loop
 * never inherits it. Both slices that reach entity storage open one: the entity tick group for the entities it
 * ticks and the block-entity tick group for the entities its tickers reach through the region-scoped query.
 * <p>
 * The lease id makes a lease unusable as soon as a newer lease was opened on the same thread: a nested
 * scope replaces the enclosing one instead of inheriting it, and a scope that was closed can never grant a
 * mutation again. Closing a scope restores the enclosing scope of the same thread, so the lease is
 * re-entrant in the strict stack order of its opening.
 * <p>
 * This is field-level ownership of the entities a group ticks, not entity storage ownership. Only the
 * vanilla mutations listed in {@link #GRANTABLE_OPERATIONS} and the removals listed in
 * {@link #GRANTABLE_REMOVAL_OPERATIONS} are granted; level admission, subclass mutations that run additional
 * side effects and every guard without an entity argument stay rejected. The lease makes no atomicity claim
 * about entity storage, tracking, cross-region reads, chunk state or the vanilla section index: those keep
 * their server-thread handoff and their storage guard. The only storage read the lease adds is the
 * region-scoped range query of its own physical bucket; see {@link RegionScopedEntityQuery}.
 * <p>
 * A position change of an entity that is <em>added to a level</em> also reaches two server-owned level
 * effects after it wrote the position and bounds: {@code EntityInLevelCallback#onMove} - for a real entity
 * the {@code PersistentEntitySectionManager.Callback}, which rejects a native worker through the
 * storage-level guard - publishes the entity section, and the target chunk is acquired through the
 * server-owned chunk source. The lease therefore grants such a move only when the batch can defer both
 * effects: the worker records the section publication and the target chunk acquisition with
 * {@link #deferEntitySectionUpdate(Entity, EntityInLevelCallback, double, double, double)} and the barrier
 * applies them on the server thread. When the batch cannot defer them - the lease outlived its batch, or
 * the caller is not a native worker - the move keeps today's refusal. {@code Entity#isAddedToLevel()} is
 * the Neo marker that the server sets when it admits an entity and clears when the entity leaves the
 * level, so it is exactly the population whose position change needs the deferral.
 * <p>
 * A removal of an entity added to the level is the second mutation with a server-owned effect: the vanilla
 * removal sets the entity's own removal state and then runs its level callback, which removes the entity
 * from the level's storage. The lease therefore grants a removal only when the batch can defer that
 * callback: the worker records it with
 * {@link #deferEntityRemoval(Entity, EntityInLevelCallback, Entity.RemovalReason)} and the barrier applies it
 * on the server thread. The entity is removed for the rest of the worker tick, because the worker itself set
 * the removal state. A removal of an entity that is not added to a level has no server-owned effect and
 * needs no deferral.
 * <p>
 * An admission of a new entity is the third mutation with a server-owned effect, and the only one that is
 * split: <b>field writes are unrestricted for pending entities, admission is lease-contained</b>. The
 * position writes of an entity that is not added to a level are granted without a position condition
 * ({@link #GRANTABLE_PENDING_ADMISSION_OPERATIONS}), because such an entity has the {@code NULL} level
 * callback and no server-owned effect - the vanilla constructor of every entity starts at
 * {@code (0, 0, 0)} before the subclass writes the real position, so a containment test on the write would
 * refuse every spawn outside the region {@code (0, 0)}. The containment is enforced where it decides
 * storage: {@link #deferEntityAddition(ServerLevel, Entity)} refuses to record an admission whose position
 * is outside the leased region, and the level keeps the storage refusal for it. A recorded admission is
 * applied by the batch barrier through the unmodified {@code ServerLevel.addEntity}.
