/**
 * One tick failure that a region worker caught and recorded for the server thread to report.
 * <p>
 * Vanilla reports a failing tick by building a {@link CrashReport}. Building one enumerates the system hardware
 * through {@code oshi}/{@code JNA}, reads the memory, storage and JVM details and allocates the whole text of the
 * report, and it does so on the thread that failed. On a region worker that thread runs while the server thread
 * sits in the batch barrier waiting for it, so a single failing tick has already been observed to turn into an
 * out-of-memory or a hang. A worker therefore only records the throwable and the context it was ticking, and the
 * server thread reports the failure after the barrier and after the handoff of the batch: the report, the log
 * output and the shutdown stay vanilla's, only the thread that produces them changed.
 * <p>
 * The recorded context is what the report cannot carry: the report is built later, on the server thread, so the
 * slice, the region, the tick and the worker that failed are only known from this record.
 *
 * @param slice        the level tick slice the failure happened in
 * @param coordinate   the region whose worker group failed
 * @param tick         the game time of the level tick that failed
 * @param entity       the entity whose tick failed, or {@code null} for a unit that vanilla reports at the tick
 *                     boundary without naming it - a block-entity ticker, a chunk, a scheduled tick, a spawn
 * @param workerThread the name of the worker thread that recorded the failure
 * @param throwable    the failure
