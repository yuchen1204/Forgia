/**
 * Admission snapshot of the block-entity tickers of one loaded chunk.
 * <p>
 * The snapshot holds every ticker the chunk currently owns in the order the level's own ticker list would
 * tick it, together with the three decisions the plan used to re-evaluate for every ticker of every level
 * tick: the allowlist of the compatibility declaration, the interior-chunk rule of the ticker's chunk and the
 * exact binding capture. Building it costs one admission per ticker; reusing it costs one chunk lookup per
 * chunk per tick, and the workers iterate the admitted tickers themselves, so the server thread never walks
 * the tickers.
 * <p>
 * The snapshot is stored on the {@code LevelChunk} itself, so exactly one snapshot exists per loaded chunk
 * and it is released with the chunk: {@code LevelChunk.clearAllBlockEntities()} is what
 * {@code ServerLevel.unload(LevelChunk)} runs, and it drops the snapshot. Chunk churn therefore cannot grow
 * the snapshot set, and {@link #liveSnapshotCount()} makes that bound observable.
 * <p>
 * The snapshot is reused only while {@link #isCurrent(RegionLayout, long, boolean)} holds. It is invalidated at
 * every point that can change its content:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a ticker was added, removed or rebound: {@code LevelChunk.updateBlockEntityTicker} and
 * {@code LevelChunk.removeBlockEntityTicker} bump the chunk's ticker revision, and
 * {@code LevelChunk.clearAllBlockEntities} bumps it and releases the snapshot;</li>
 * <li>the chunk unloaded, was replaced or lost its block entities: the same release in
 * {@code LevelChunk.clearAllBlockEntities};</li>
 * <li>the region layout or its fixed size changed: the layout instance is part of the validity check;</li>
 * <li>border propagation changed: boundary furnace admission requires that protocol.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A region merge, a split or an empty retirement does not invalidate the snapshot: the snapshot holds no
 * region state, and the batch resolves the region of every chunk from the regionizer.
 * Everything else is not cached here: the entity-load eligibility of the chunk stays a per-tick, per-chunk
 * read on the server thread, and the binding capture of a ticker is re-checked against the live ticker
 * before its admission is used.
