/**
 * The bounded, ordered cross-region mailbox of one level.
 * <p>
 * A region that has to affect another region, or that has to ask the server thread to change global state,
 * posts a message instead of touching the target directly. The mailbox owns one queue per target region and one
 * global queue:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A message to a region is delivered at the start of that region's next tick, on the worker that holds the
 * region lease, in posting order. The delivery runs before the body of the slice group that leases the region,
 * inside the batch that owns the lease, so its block writes are recorded for the batch barrier like the writes
 * of the slice itself. A message posted while the region is already ticking is delivered by the next group that
 * leases the region, which is the next slice of the same level tick or the same slice of the next tick.</li>
 * <li>A message to the global queue is delivered on the server thread at the beginning of the next global phase
 * ({@link LevelTickPhase#GLOBAL}): the head of the level tick for a post made outside a region phase, and the
 * end of the region phase for a post a worker made. Its body therefore runs with no region batch in flight,
 * before the vanilla level tick continues.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both queues are bounded. {@link #post} returns the outcome instead of blocking, so a sender can observe a
 * refusal:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link PostResult#ACCEPTED}: the message is queued.</li>
 * <li>{@link PostResult#QUEUE_FULL}: the target queue is at its bound; the message is not queued and the
 * refusal is counted. The bound is per queue, so one flooded region cannot refuse the messages of another.</li>
 * <li>{@link PostResult#TARGET_RETIRED}: the target region does not exist, or is retired; the message is not
 * queued and the drop is counted. A message is addressed to one region instance, so it is never delivered to a
 * different region that later reuses the same coordinate - a queued message whose region retired before its
 * delivery is counted and dropped when a region at that coordinate next ticks.</li>
 * <li>{@link PostResult#MAILBOX_CLOSED}: the mailbox was closed by the level unload or the engine shutdown; the
 * message is not queued and the refusal is counted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Closing the mailbox is deterministic: it drops every queued message of every queue, counting each drop, and
 * refuses every later post. A message is delivered at most once; a body that throws is counted as a delivery
 * failure and logged for the first few failures, and it never aborts the level tick or a region group, because
 * one message cannot be allowed to kill the tick it was delivered in.
 * <p>
 * The mailbox has no producer in the production code of this milestone: it is the primitive the later
 * cross-region work (redstone, structures, weather effects, teleports) posts through, and only tests post to it
 * today. A level without a mailbox costs one map lookup per region phase end and per level tick entry, and no
 * message is ever allocated.
