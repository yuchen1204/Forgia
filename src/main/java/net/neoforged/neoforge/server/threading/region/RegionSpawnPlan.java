/**
 * The natural spawning of one level tick that the server thread hands to the region workers.
 * <p>
 * The plan does not decide which chunks may spawn: {@code ServerChunkCache.tickChunks} already walks the level's
 * chunk list and evaluates the spawn gate per chunk - the natural spawning ticket and the player distance, the
 * domino spawning rule, the friends/enemies switches, the world border and the forced-tick ticket, all of them
 * reads of the distance manager, the chunk map and the level data that only the server thread may make - and it
 * hands every chunk that may spawn to {@link #accept(LevelChunk, boolean)}. The decision therefore stays where
 * vanilla makes it, and the plan only decides whether the spawn body may run on a worker.
 * <p>
 * A chunk is handed over when
 * <ul>
 * <li>its eight neighboring chunks are loaded, so no chunk read of the spawn body - the candidate positions, the
 * spawn rules, the heightmap, the biome - has to force-load a chunk from a worker: the worker chunk source
 * refuses a load instead of waiting for the server thread that is waiting for the worker, and</li>
 * <li>the batch could reserve the block-write effects of the chunk, so a block a modded spawn hook writes has
 * somewhere to be recorded (the vanilla body writes no block).</li>
 * </ul>
 * Every other chunk spawns on the server thread at the point vanilla spawns it and is counted by reason: the gate
 * refused, a neighbor is not loaded, or the batch had no room left.
 * <p>
 * The mob cap of a region is the level-wide cap of the tick: {@link LevelSpawnCapCounter} counts the level's mobs
 * per category on the server thread at plan start, exactly like the vanilla spawn state counts them, and every
 * region's state reserves its slot there (see {@link #buildRegionState(RegionState, List)}). A chunk's spawn body
 * draws from a random source derived from the world seed, the dimension, the game time, the region and the chunk
 * (see {@link RegionSpawnChunk#spawnSeed}), so a region's spawn sequence depends neither on the other regions nor
 * on the worker that runs it. The chunks the plan keeps on the server thread spawn from the vanilla level-wide
 * state, exactly like vanilla, and that state is created on demand: a tick that hands every spawnable chunk to a
 * worker never builds it, but it shares the level-wide count of the tick.
