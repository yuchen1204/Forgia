/**
 * One chunk's share of a block-entity worker tick.
 * <p>
 * The plan hands the worker the chunk and the tickers it collected for it, so the worker iterates the
 * chunk's admitted tickers itself instead of the server thread walking the level's ticker list. The
 * admissions are in the order the level's own ticker list would tick them, so a worker group reproduces the
 * tick order of the region it owns.
 * <p>
 * A unit of the chunk-indexed plan carries the chunk and its admission snapshot, and the worker revalidates
 * the snapshot against the live chunk before it ticks anything: a chunk that unloaded or changed its ticker
 * set since the plan handed it over is ticked on the server thread instead of from the stale snapshot. A unit
 * of the explicit per-ticker admission carries no snapshot, because each of its admissions revalidates its
 * own binding and position.
