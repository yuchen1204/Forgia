/**
 * Admission scope of exactly one block-entity invocation on a region worker.
 * <p>
 * The server checks entity-load eligibility before collecting the immutable admission. Only that
 * ticker and its captured bound delegate may replace the guarded manager read, while the binding,
 * position, level and region lease still match. Siblings and same-position replacements are excluded.
 * <p>
 * This relies on the current server phase: manager tick, save, unload and close do not run during an
 * active block-entity batch; its barrier services chunk-source tasks. Both manager tick and saving
 * ({@code autoSave}/{@code saveAll}) can unload a chunk and remove its {@code LOADED} status. This
 * scope does not make arbitrary future reentrant manager saving safe.
 * <p>
 * One scope object is kept per worker thread and reused for the next ticker of the same thread: a
 * ticker opens and closes a scope, and allocating one object plus replacing the thread-local entry for
 * every ticker was a measurable part of the per-ticker worker cost. A nested open - a ticker that starts
 * another admitted ticker - still gets its own object linked to the enclosing one, exactly like before.
