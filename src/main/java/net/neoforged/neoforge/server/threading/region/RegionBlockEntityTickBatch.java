/**
 * One level block-entity tick that is executed on region workers.
 * <p>
 * The batch is the set of chunks the plan handed over, each with the tickers it admitted. Each group owns the
 * lease of exactly one region and ticks the chunks of that region, whose tickers it merges back into the
 * order of the level's own ticker list, so different regions run in parallel while a region never ticks
 * against itself. Chunks whose region cannot be leased safely, and chunks whose snapshot went stale before
 * the worker ticked them, are ticked on the server thread after the batch instead of being dropped.
 * <p>
 * A group also carries the entity ownership lease of its region, so a ticker whose compatibility declaration
 * admits entity work reaches the entities of its own region through the region-scoped query and its mutations
 * of them go through the same grants as an entity tick group. The lease is only opened for the tickers of
 * that group and closed before the region lease, and it defers the server-owned storage effect of a granted
 * removal to the barrier of this batch: a hopper that absorbs an item entity of its region removes the
 * entity's own state on the worker and the barrier runs the level callback on the server thread.
 * <p>
 * The batch also carries the two server-owned structures a block-entity tick can reach through a neighbor
 * update: the deferred mutations of {@code LevelTicks} and the removal records of the ownership lease. A ticker
 * that writes a block - its own state, the container it reads - records the light recheck and the block update
 * publication of the write in the deferred queue every region batch shares, so the worker never drives the
 * level-wide light engine or the level-wide block update publication. A ticker whose reservation does not fit
 * into that queue is refused before its body and ticked on the server thread after the batch.
