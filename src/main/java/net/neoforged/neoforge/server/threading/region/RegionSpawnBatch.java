/**
 * One level tick's natural spawning that is executed on region workers.
 * <p>
 * The batch is the set of chunks the server thread decided may spawn and could hand over, grouped by the region
 * that owns the chunk. A group leases its region and holds the {@code SpawnState} of that region, which is built
 * from the region's own entities but capped by the level-wide mob count of the tick. A region's chunks spawn in the
 * order the level's chunk list collected them, and different regions run in parallel while a region never spawns
 * against itself.
 * <p>
 * A group also carries the entity ownership lease of its region, so a spawn body reaches entity storage through
 * the same grants as an entity tick: the entity it creates is a pending entity whose position writes are field
 * writes, the admission is recorded for the barrier and the barrier runs the unmodified vanilla admission on the
 * server thread. A spawn that lands in the region next to the one that decided it is recorded as well: vanilla
 * picks the position without regard to the region border, and the barrier admits into whichever region stores the
 * entity.
 * <p>
 * The batch also carries the two structures a spawn body writes: the deferred block-write effects of any block a
 * modded spawn hook or a mob's equipment writes (through {@link RegionTickBatch}), and the removals a spawn body
 * could cause. It defers no section updates: a spawn body only positions entities that are not in the level yet.
 * <p>
 * Chunks whose region cannot be leased, whose batch cannot reserve their block-write effects and whose body was
 * truncated by an unavailable chunk are spawned on the server thread after the batch instead of being dropped.
