/**
 * One batch of region-scoped work that is submitted to the worker pool and awaited by the submitting
 * thread before it continues.
 * <p>
 * A group is the unit of region exclusivity: the caller adds one group per region, so the pool can run
 * different regions in parallel while a region can never run against itself. {@link #submit} returns a
 * {@link Barrier} that completes only after every submitted group finished or failed, which gives the
 * server thread a single point to wait on before it touches state the workers may be mutating.
 * <p>
 * A group the executor rejects or fails to accept runs on the submitting thread instead of being dropped,
 * so a closing pool can never strand the barrier. The first failure of any group is recorded and rethrown
 * by the submitting thread through {@link Barrier#throwIfFailed()} once the whole batch is complete; the
 * remaining failures are reported by the worker pool itself.
 * <p>
 * {@link #addPacked(String, List)} adds several groups as one task. The groups keep their own barrier
 * permit, their own failure record and their own release of the state they acquired - packing only shares
 * the submission and the completion of a task between them - so a packed group behaves exactly like a
 * submitted one, and a failing group neither stops the groups packed with it nor completes their permits.
