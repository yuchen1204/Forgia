/**
 * Native NeoForge region threading engine shell.
 * <p>
 * This class is intentionally small until the Folia regionizer and tick loop are ported.
 * <p>
 * The engine owns the server-thread side of every deferred effect of a region worker. For the entity tick
 * slice that is the section publication and target chunk acquisition of a move, the level callback of a
 * removal and the admission of a new entity, applied in that order at the barrier of one entity batch
 * (section updates, removals, admissions, fallback ticks, server tasks, ownership publication). The
 * admission is the one step that changes a caller-visible contract: on a native worker whose lease covers
 * the entity's position, {@code ServerLevel.addFreshEntity} answers <b>"accepted for this tick"</b> instead
 * of "already in the world". The entity is not visible to the level for the rest of the worker tick and the
 * barrier admits it afterwards through the unmodified vanilla path; an admission the barrier cannot apply is
 * <b>dropped</b>, which loses the entity, and is counted in
 * {@link RegionThreadingDiagnostics#deferredEntityAdditionsDropped()} next to the applied and recorded
 * admissions. Entity construction events ({@code EntityEvent.EntityConstructing}, {@code EntityEvent.Size})
 * therefore fire on the worker thread; that is a documented compatibility exposure, not a defect of the
 * admission.
 * <p>
 * The block event phase is the one part of the level tick that is not a region slice: it drains the level's
 * ordered block event set on the server thread after every region batch of the tick returned, so no worker runs
 * and no region is leased by another thread. The phase therefore runs as a server-thread quiescent scope
 * ({@link #beginBlockEventPhase(ServerLevel)}): it takes the lease of each region its events run in once, keeps it
 * until the phase ends and captures no border update, so a write of an event body to another region is the
 * vanilla inline call and the phase needs no border fixpoint at all. That is both cheaper than leasing and
 * flushing per event and faithful to the inline run: an event body reads back what it wrote, so a piston that
 * pushes across a border resolves its structure against the moved blocks and queues the single block event
 * vanilla queues, not a second one from a stale read.
 * <p>
 * The game event dispatch is the one cross-region write that is not a block write: {@code GameEventDispatcher.post}
 * reaches every listener of the event's notification radius - 16 blocks for the common events, 32 for
 * {@code shriek} - and a listener writes its own block entity, so with a 3-chunk region the dispatch crosses a
 * border in the common case. {@link #captureCrossRegionGameEvent} records a section column whose listeners belong
 * to another region instead of visiting it, and {@link #runCrossRegionGameEvents} replays the recorded columns on
 * the owning region's worker in the same tick, in recording order, after the border fixpoint of the batch. The
 * replay uses the vanilla listener registry of the target column, so the candidate a sculk sensor records carries
 * the same source position, distance and game time as the inline run, and the sensor activates on the same tick.
 * The switch is off by default: with it off the dispatch is exactly vanilla and therefore races as before, which
 * is the documented baseline of the feature.

     * the server thread instead of failing the group of its region at the first such tick. The declarations
     * are deliberately narrow - a type that only reaches the granted funnel stays on the worker:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code Slime} (and therefore {@code MagmaCube}): {@code Slime.remove} creates the child slimes of a
     * dead slime <em>before</em> it reaches the removal funnel, so the split is an entity addition inside a
     * removal callback the lease does not grant. A slime that dies in its own tick - fire, drowning, a fall,
     * another mob's attack that the same worker resolves - would otherwise abort the group and crash the
     * server.</li>
     * <li>{@code FishingHook}: its tick discards the hook in five places (the owner is gone, the hook hits a
     * block, the hook is in lava, the reel-in ends), and {@code discard} funnels into
     * {@code FishingHook.remove}, which returns the caught item and the rod damage to the owner before it
     * reaches the funnel.</li>
     * <li>{@code Projectile}: impact damage, enchantments and mod callbacks can mutate the victim, owner
     * or a third entity. Geometry/target ownership alone cannot prove that footprint. Until a complete
     * impact continuation exists, pin the whole tick before effects; specific declarations retain their
     * more precise diagnostic reasons.</li>
     * <li>{@code Shulker}: opening its shell directly moves nearby entities with {@code MoverType.SHULKER},
     * including players and entities stored across a region border. This bypasses the deferred push funnel;
     * pin the entire tick (and subclasses) before effects start instead of skipping or replaying lid pushes.</li>
     * <li>{@code ThrownEnderpearl}: both impact and end-gateway contact can mutate its owner, including player
     * connection teleports, dismount, damage and dimension changes. The complete tick stays on the server thread:
     * deferring only onHit would let ThrowableProjectile continue moving before the impact callback reads the
     * pearl's position, and would miss onInsideBlock's gateway path. Subclasses inherit this restriction.</li>
     * <li>{@code FireworkRocketEntity}: attached flight writes another entity's velocity and explosion damage
     * directly reaches its attached entity (including players) and nearby targets.</li>
     * <li>{@code WitherSkull}: impact damages a target, may heal its owner and then explodes. Neither the owner
     * nor the victims are necessarily in the projectile's entity lease. Keep the complete tick inline until
     * these whole operations have an ownership protocol; do not replay a partially applied impact.</li>
     * </ul>

     * <p>
     * <strong>Bound.</strong> The bound is the level's {@code max-chained-neighbor-updates} limit, the number
     * vanilla uses for one cascade (default {@code 1000000}). A negative configured value means unlimited in
     * vanilla; the fixpoint then uses {@link SharedConstants#MAX_CHAINED_NEIGHBOR_UPDATES} so it can never spin.
     * The bound applies to the border updates applied by the passes and to the number of passes, because every

     * <strong>Foreign reads.</strong> A propagation group reads block states, fluids and block entities of the
     * neighbouring regions, and a chunk of another region can change between two of those reads. Every region
     * records the version of each foreign chunk it read ({@link RegionState#foreignChunkReads()}), and the
     * version of every position it wrote ({@link RegionState#rerunSeeds()}). The check runs once for the worker
     * phase before the first pass and once per region after its propagation group. A region whose observed
     * version changed re-runs its propagation - the updates it applied, plus a re-evaluation of the positions it
     * wrote - in the next pass. The re-run is bounded by the same pass bound and falls back to the same mailbox,

     * Replays the game event columns the workers of the batch that just ended captured for other regions, and

     * <p>
     * <strong>Why here.</strong> The replay runs on the server thread after the worker phase returned and before
     * the next slice of the level tick, so no worker of the batch runs and the target region's worker is the only
     * thread that touches the target state. That is the same point the border fixpoint runs at, and the game
     * events follow it, because the deferred block writes of the source are applied before the listener body
     * reads the world - the order the inline run has, where the write and the dispatch are in one call stack.
     * <p>
     * <strong>The ordering requirement.</strong> A vibration listener records a candidate with the level's game
     * time and {@code VibrationSelector} only compares candidates of the same game time: a candidate of another
     * tick is refused outright, and {@code chosenCandidate} selects a candidate only in a later game time than
     * the one it was recorded in. The activation tick of a sculk sensor is therefore fixed by the game time of
     * the recording and by the distance the candidate carries, and both are decided by the vanilla dispatch - the
     * source position is captured and the distance is re-measured against the listener's own position on the
     * target worker. Replaying in the same tick reproduces the recording tick; replaying one tick later would
     * move every activation by one tick. Within a tick the selector's tie-break (nearest distance, then highest
     * frequency) is order independent except for the degenerate tie of equal distance and equal frequency, where
     * the first recorded candidate wins; the delivery keeps the recording order, so the first candidate is the
     * one the inline dispatch would have recorded first.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Order.</strong> A pass groups the pending columns by the region that owns them, in first-seen order,
     * and replays one region after another, so a listener of the second region sees the state the first region's
     * listener bodies left. Within one region the columns are replayed in recording order, and the replay of one
     * column keeps the vanilla iteration order of the column. The listener bodies of a pass can post further game
     * events for another region and write blocks whose neighbor updates cross a border, so the pass runs the
     * border fixpoint again and the next pass replays what that produced.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Bound.</strong> A pass replays at least one column, so the chained-update bound bounds the rounds
     * the same way it bounds the border fixpoint's passes. Vanilla has no bound at all here - a chain of listeners
     * that each post a new event recurses until the stack runs out - so the bound is the engine's safety net
     * against a cycle, and every column it cuts off is counted as dropped.

     * pre-load fallback, the chunk fallback, a declared server-thread-only type and the always-ticking player

     * the entity batch. Without this publication the mapping of such an entity keeps the region it started in
     * while the entity walks away, and the region index would group and lease it by a region that no longer
     * contains it.
     * <p>
     * The common case - the entity stayed inside its region - costs one read-lock lookup and one coordinate
     * comparison and writes nothing. Only a move that really crosses a region border takes the write lock and
     * notifies the entity's scheduled tasks, exactly like the deferred path does.
