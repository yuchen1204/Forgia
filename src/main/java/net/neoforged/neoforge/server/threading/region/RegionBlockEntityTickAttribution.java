/**
 * Opt-in wall-clock attribution of the server-thread block-entity tick slice.
 * <p>
 * The slice starts where the level begins its block-entity ticker pass and ends where the pass returns, so it
 * covers the whole server-thread block-entity slice of one level tick. Inside the slice the instrumentation
 * accumulates four segments: the collection and admission of the tickers up to the worker batch, the region
 * lease acquisition, the wait for the batch barrier and the deferred work that runs after the barrier.
 * <p>
 * The handoff segment is further split into the steps the publishing server thread runs after the barrier, so
 * the deferred work of a batch is attributable per step: the deferred entity removals, the server-thread
 * fallback ticks, the deferred {@code LevelTicks} mutations and the batch finish. A step that did nothing in
 * the measured workload reports zero nanoseconds and a zero count, which is how an empty step is told apart
 * from a cheap one.
 * <p>
 * The group distribution reports what the workers did with the batch: one record per region group, taken on the
 * worker that ran it, with the group's wall time, its admitted tickers and the tickers it actually ticked. The
 * aggregate - group count, mean, maximum, coefficient of variation and the per-worker busy time - separates a
 * barrier that waits for the slowest group from one that waits for work: a batch whose groups are balanced
 * reports a maximum close to the mean and a maximum close to the worker count times the mean. A latency
 * histogram of the same groups reports the percentiles, so a mean that a few very slow groups pull up is not
 * read as a uniform cost.
 * <p>
 * The fallback counters split the tickers that did not tick on a worker by the reason the slice handed them
 * back, so a workload whose whole region falls back is not confused with a workload whose snapshots went
 * stale.
 * <p>
 * The server-thread segments are measured with {@link System#nanoTime()} into plain {@code long} accumulators;
 * the group distribution is written by the workers and therefore uses additive accumulators. Nothing is
 * allocated or logged in the measured path except one accumulator entry per worker thread, so the only
 * allocation of a measured window is the per-worker load record. Only the server thread resets the
 * accumulators, between windows.
 * <p>
 * The instrumentation is disabled by default. When it is disabled every entry point returns after one
 * volatile read of {@link #isEnabled()}, which is read once per level tick and once per worker group, never
 * per ticker. A disabled attribution therefore cannot change tick behavior or cost measurable time.
 * <p>
 * The difference between {@link Snapshot#sliceNanos()} and the four segments is the batch publication and
 * setup: publishing the batch under the lifecycle gate, creating it and releasing it after the deferred
 * work.
