/**
 * One scheduled block or fluid tick phase that is executed on region workers.
 * <p>
 * The ticks are the snapshot {@code LevelTicks} selected for this tick. Each group owns the lease of
 * exactly one region and executes the snapshot ticks of that region in their original order, so different
 * regions run in parallel while a region never ticks against itself. Every tick is reported to the
 * {@code LevelTicks} per-tick hook immediately before its callback runs, so the will-tick predicate answers
 * for the ticks of this tick that have not run yet exactly as it does in the inline loop. Ticks whose region
 * cannot be leased safely are executed on the server thread after the batch instead of being dropped.
 * <p>
 * Every group owns its own {@link RandomSource}, derived from one server-thread seed source per batch.
 * A worker therefore never draws from the shared level random, and the sequence a region observes only
 * depends on the region order of this batch.
 * <p>
 * A scheduled tick that writes a block records the light recheck and the block update publication of the write
 * in the deferred queue every region batch shares, and the ticks beyond the deferred block-update bound are
 * executed on the server thread after the batch instead of on a worker.
