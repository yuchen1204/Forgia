/**
 * One chunk's share of a level tick's natural spawning, as the region worker of its region executes it.
 * <p>
 * The entry carries the chunk the server thread decided may spawn and the seed of the random source its spawn
 * body draws from. The seed is a pure function of the world seed, the dimension, the game time, the region
 * coordinate and the chunk position ({@link #spawnSeed(ServerLevel, RegionCoordinate, long)}), so a chunk's
 * spawn sequence is per-chunk deterministic: it does not depend on which other chunks spawn in the same tick, on
 * the region layout of the other regions, on the number of workers or on the thread that runs the chunk. That is
 * the property the slice needs, because the same chunk may spawn on a worker in one tick and on the server thread
 * in the next when its region cannot be leased.
 * <p>
 * Not provided: this is not the vanilla sequence. Vanilla spawns every chunk of a level from one level-wide
 * {@link RandomSource}, so a chunk's spawns there depend on every chunk spawned before it in the same tick - on
 * the shuffle, on the number of level chunks and on every spawn attempt of the chunks before it. The regionized
 * slice keeps the distribution of every draw (each source is a {@code LegacyRandomSource} seeded per chunk) but
 * not the order of the vanilla sequence, and a comparison of two runs can only compare populations and rates.
