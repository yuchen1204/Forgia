/**
 * One level entity tick that is executed on region workers.
 * <p>
 * Each group is the unit of region exclusivity and carries the entities that the group is allowed to tick
 * inline. {@link Group#owns(Entity)} only accepts the snapshot members of that group (and their vehicle
 * chain), so work for an entity that belongs to another region is never executed under this group's
 * lease. Such foreign work is queued and executed on the server thread after the batch completed.
 * <p>
 * Ownership changes that happen while a batch owns an entity are recorded as deferred updates and
 * published after the batch finished, so the snapshot region stays authoritative for the duration of the
 * current tick and no new region work can start for the entity before the handoff. Each deferred update
 * carries the destination region that the deferring thread observed, so the handoff is published to that
 * destination instead of one re-derived from the entity's live position at the barrier.
 * <p>
 * A worker that moves an entity added to its level cannot run the level effects of that move: the
 * {@link EntityInLevelCallback#onMove()} publication of the entity section and the target chunk
 * acquisition are server-owned storage. The worker records one deferred section update per move instead,
 * and the barrier applies both effects on the server thread from the entity's final position.
 * <p>
 * A worker that removes an entity it owns cannot run the level callback of the removal either: it writes the
 * entity's own removal state and records one deferred removal, and the barrier runs the callback on the
 * server thread, so the section membership, the tracking and ticking callbacks, the identity ledger and the
 * region index are written exactly like a server-thread removal. A removal of an entity that is already
 * recorded is a counted no-op, so an entity is never removed twice.
 * <p>
 * A worker that admits an entity into its level records one deferred admission per riding graph instead of
 * running the vanilla admission, and the barrier runs the unmodified {@code ServerLevel.addEntity} for every
 * member of the graph on the server thread. The record therefore carries the whole self-and-passenger graph,
 * which is admitted whole or counted as dropped; the members the caller adds one by one (as
 * {@code addFreshEntityWithPassengers} does) are no-ops of the graph that already carries them.
 * <p>
 * A worker whose entity enters a portal records the transition instead of resolving it: the destination search
 * reads the {@code PoiManager} of the destination level, and every entity type reaches it through
 * {@code Entity#handlePortal}, so no type declaration can keep it off a worker. The barrier resolves and
 * applies at most one transition per entity on the server thread, before it applies the other deferred effects
 * of the tick.
 * <p>
 * An entity tick that writes a block - a placed block, a lit fire, a snow layer - records the light recheck and
 * the block update publication of the write in the deferred queue every region batch shares, so the worker
 * never drives the level-wide light engine or the level-wide block update publication. An entity whose
 * reservation does not fit into that queue is refused before its body and ticked on the server thread after the
 * batch.
