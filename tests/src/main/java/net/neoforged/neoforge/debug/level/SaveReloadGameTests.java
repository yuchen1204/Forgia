/**
 * Proves that a world built with region threading enabled survives a save and a reload, and that a hard kill
 * leaves a world that loads with the state of its last save point.
 * <p>
 * The two tests are one milestone with two halves:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #savesAndReloadsRegionThreadingState} builds a quiescent but rich fixture - blocks, block
 * entities with contents, villagers that claimed a bed and a workstation, animals, a POI set with taken
 * tickets and a redstone circuit that crosses a region border - saves the level, unloads every chunk of the
 * area and loads it back from disk, then compares every block, every block entity, every entity UUID and
 * position, every POI record with its free-ticket count and the region every position maps to. It runs in the
 * default GameTest batch with region threading on and, through the {@code saveReload} reference run, with
 * region threading off: the reference run compares its own observable state with the state the on-run
 * recorded, which is the "saved with regions on, loaded with regions off" half of the guarantee.</li>
 * <li>{@link #recoversAfterAHardKill} is driven by an external kill. The {@code prepare} phase builds the
 * fixture, saves, records the state of that save point and then halts the JVM from another thread while the
 * server is ticking, which is a hard kill with no shutdown hook and no flush of anything after the save. The
 * {@code recover} phase starts on the same world directory, asserts that the world loads, that the state of
 * the save point is intact, that no entity UUID was duplicated, that the identity ledger is rebuilt from the
 * level instead of remembering anything from the killed process, that no POI ticket leaked, and then runs the
 * invariants for another {@value #RECOVERY_TICKS} ticks.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Why the fixture is quiescent</h2>
 * The comparison needs a state that does not move between the moment it is captured and the moment it is
 * checked again. Region threading does not change what a save observes, but the game keeps ticking across an
 * unload and a reload, so every mob of the fixture is switched to {@code NoAI} once the villagers claimed
 * their POIs: their positions and their claims stay, no crop grows (the GameTest server runs with random ticks
 * off anyway), the chests and barrels are not connected to a hopper and the redstone circuit is powered by a
 * lever, which is a state and not a clock. Everything the fixture writes is recorded, so the comparison is a
 * comparison of exactly the positions the fixture owns.
