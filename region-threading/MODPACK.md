# Mod pack status: SkyExplorer v0.1.5 (170 mods, NeoForge 21.1.249)

The pack is the compatibility target: Minecraft 1.21.1, NeoForge 21.1.249, 170 mod jars including c2me,
Connector, FTB Chunks, Quark and Create. This file records what works, what does not, and why - measured with
`tools/modpack-matrix`, which boots the installed server on a selected set of mods and classifies the outcome.

## Result

| Configuration | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **All 170 jars, including Connector and Forgified Fabric API** | **reaches `Done` in 83 s** |

So the whole pack - region threading, the patched vanilla classes, Create, Quark, c2me, FTB Chunks and the
Fabric mods loaded through Connector - loads and ticks under Forgia.

## How the pack is run

The loader identifies itself as `21.1.250.x-beta`, which satisfies every dependency range in the pack
(`[21.1.219,)` through `[21.1.247,)`); the version comes from a git tag, so a compatibility build is
`git tag 21.1.<n>-beta` before `:neoforge:installerJar`. Install with the produced installer into a copy of the
pack, then start with the pack's own `unix_args.txt`.

## Incompatibilities found, in the order they were hit

### 1. Moonlight `ServerLevelMixin` - fixed

`@WrapOperation` on `new PersistentEntitySectionManager<>(Entity.class, callbacks, storage)`.
Our patch had changed that call to five arguments (storage guard + section layout), so the injection point did
not exist. Moonlight is mandatory for Supplementaries, so it could not be dropped.

Fixed by restoring the vanilla call byte for byte and taking the guard and the layout from the level instead:
`ServerLevel.EntityCallbacks` receives a NeoForge **injected interface** (`ServerEntityStorageOwner`) that
exposes the level, and the manager installs both from it. No constructor parameter, no access transformer, no
signature change.

### 2. Forgified Fabric API `server.WorldChunkMixin` - fixed

`@Inject` into `LevelChunk.setBlockEntity` and `removeBlockEntity`, capturing the block entity that gets
replaced or removed. Our patches had moved those method bodies into `setBlockEntityUnderMutation` and friends so
a seqlock could wrap them, which removed the injectable code.

Fixed by keeping every body where vanilla puts it and wrapping it in place: `beginChunkMutation()` before a
`try`, `endChunkMutation()` in the `finally`. Adding statements and an exception table does not move the code a
mixin anchors on; moving it into a helper does.

### 3. Connector / Forgified Fabric API - fixed

This was a harder kind of problem: not a method body that moved, but the **exact instruction sequence** around
vanilla calls.

```
@Inject(method = "setBlockEntity",
        at = @At(value = "INVOKE", target = "Ljava/util/Map;put(...)", shift = At.Shift.BY, by = 3))
```

`shift = BY 3` means "three instructions after the `Map.put`", which is brittle against any patch - ours or
NeoForge's - that inserts something nearby. `onRemoveBlockEntity` uses a `@Redirect` inside a `@Slice` anchored
on a field access in `getBlockEntity`, which our foreign-read branch perturbs.

Fixed by keeping the instruction *neighbourhood* of those methods vanilla as well:

* the foreign-read branch of `getBlockEntity` moved into a private `foreignBlockEntityOrNull` helper, so the
  method itself only gains one call and one branch at the top and vanilla's `Map.remove` sits where the
  `@Slice` expects it;
* the auxiliary-light removal in `setBlockEntity` moved *before* the `Map.put` (it clears the light of the entity
  being replaced, which is the same position), so the instructions after `Map.put` are exactly vanilla's again
  and the `shift = BY 3` injection lands where the mod expects.

The rule that comes out of all three: a patch may add statements, but it must not move a body, change a
signature, or change which instructions follow a call a mod offsets from.

The pack's own `netherexp` and `modernfix` mixins also log optional injection failures for the same reason
(instruction-level assumptions) but are non-fatal.

## With the engine forced on

The table above disables every worker slice for this pack, which made it impossible to tell whether the mods
actually work. `regionThreadingForceWithKnownConflicts` (measurement only, logged loudly) installs the engine
anyway, with every conflict still detected and reported.

First measurement, all 170 mods with the full engine:

| | Result |
|---|---|
| Boot to `Done` | **37.7 s** |
| Region workers | 7 alive |
| Ownership violations, tick failures over 11 minutes | **0** |
| Shutdown | **hangs** - the server thread parks in `MinecraftServer.waitForTasks` (modernfix's `waitLongerForTasks`) while the `c2me-worker-*` threads die |

So the engine survives with the whole pack up, and **c2me is confirmed incompatible by evidence rather than by
reputation**: it owns chunk threads that the engine's shutdown path does not wait for.

### Without c2me, the other nine conflicts are fine

Same harness, all 169 jars (everything but c2me), engine forced on, a flat world, 169 chunks force-loaded and
32 mobs summoned through the console:

| | Result |
|---|---|
| Boot to `Done` | yes |
| Run window | 120 s |
| Stop | clean, inside the grace period |
| **Entity ticks on workers** | **96 309** |
| Cross-region reads recorded | 6 566 |
| Ownership violations | **0** |
| Tick failures | 0 |

So modernfix, moonlight, sable, byepregen, ftbchunks, alltheleaks, create, spawn and mobspawncontroller all
coexist with the engine in this run - the static table is far more conservative than the evidence.

Those nine rows now carry a `REPORT_ONLY` action: they are still detected and reported by
`/neoforge regionthreading compat`, but they no longer remove a slice, because a run with the engine and all of
them produced no violation. Later production evidence supersedes the `mobspawncontroller` row: its
`FinalizeSpawnEvent` structure filter reaches `StructureManager.fillStartsForStructure` and synchronously
requests missing `STRUCTURE_STARTS` chunks (for example `(51,-52)`). It now carries `DISABLE_SPAWNING`:
only natural spawning returns to the server thread, before any spawn body or listener runs. The existing
`regionThreadingForceWithKnownConflicts` harness override can still bypass this action and reproduce the
hazard; normal deployments should leave it false. The entity, block-entity and chunk slices remain available.
This is containment through serial spawning, not concurrent chunk-loading support or a replay of a partially
executed spawn attempt. **c2me keeps `DISABLE_ENGINE`**, which makes the pack usable with the engine on:

```
enableRegionThreadingBridge = true
enableRegionThreadingEntityTicks = true
...                            # every slice, no force flag
# and c2me removed from mods/
```

Measured that way in the harness - real policy, no force flag, 169 jars, flat world, 169 chunks force-loaded
and 32 mobs summoned: engine enabled, **92 101 entity ticks on region workers**, 6 701 cross-region reads, zero
ownership violations, clean shutdown.


Two things this run does **not** prove, and the harness cannot prove yet: chunk ticks on workers stayed at zero
in the flat world with only force-loaded chunks, so the chunk slice is still unverified there; and an idle world
with 32 mobs is not a loaded server.

### A real API gap the pack exposed

The first no-c2me run crashed in `ChunkMap` with

```
NoSuchMethodError: 'java.util.EnumSet ChunkStatus.getChunkSaveHeightmaps()'
```

from ByePregen: NeoForge added that method (the MC-308222 heightmap fix) after the snapshot this fork was
based on. The upstream patch was taken verbatim and applied; the run then booted and stopped cleanly. Any other
mod calling a newer NeoForge API will fail the same way, so a systematic patch-set comparison with upstream
21.1.249 is now the known next step rather than a suspicion.

## Reproducing

```bash
git tag 21.1.250-beta
./gradlew --offline :neoforge:installerJar
java -jar projects/neoforge/build/libs/neoforge-21.1.250.*-installer.jar --installServer /path/to/pack-copy

# one group
printf '%s\n' "Quark-4.1-482.jar" > /tmp/group.txt
tools/modpack-matrix/run_group.sh /path/to/pack-copy /tmp/group.txt quark

# the whole pack, bisecting to the failing jar
python3 tools/modpack-matrix/bisect_mods.py /path/to/pack-copy --parallel 2
```

A run takes about 25 seconds because the runner stops the server as soon as `Done` or an error appears.

## What this does and does not prove

Reaching `Done` proves that the mods load and that the server ticks its first ticks with Forgia's patched
classes; it does not prove gameplay equivalence under load. Region threading is **off by default** in the pack's
configuration, so this is a drop-in compatibility result first. Turning the slices on with 168 mods is the next
step, and the conflict table (`/neoforge regionthreading compat`) already names c2me, modernfix, moonlight,
alltheleaks, voxy, byepregen, sable, spawn and mobspawncontroller as mods that fight the region model.
